# CHALLENGE2-PORTFOLIO
Bootstrap Portfolio Site (From Scratch)
The goal was to build a responsive portfolio using Flexbox and other CSS and deploying it on GitHub Pages.

Requirements
Sections: About, Projects, Contact
Navbar with anchors to sections
Mobile-first responsive behavior
Submission: Repo URL + live GitHub Pages URL.
I created a portfolio which I'll need to make some adjustments since it's not according to the requirements.
I'm proud of myself for my progress anyway :))))
